### **Website Features (User Side)**:

2. **Slot Booking System**: Users can select a convenient time slot for their pest control service booking. The system ensures that the user gets the right time and date based on their preferences.
   
3. **Payment Integration**: After booking a slot, users can pay the required amount for the service using an integrated payment system, which ensures a seamless payment experience.

4. **Ongoing and Future Offers**: Users can view any ongoing offers and upcoming discounts directly on the website. This feature helps users take advantage of promotional deals.

### **Admin Panel Features (Company Side)**:
