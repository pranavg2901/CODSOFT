## üìú Introduction

**Beginning Solutions** is a software company that developed this project, **Super Star Pest Control Services**. The project consists of two main components:

1. **Website for Users**: A user-friendly website for browsing and booking pest control services. This is accessible to customers who need pest control services from **Super Star Pest Control**.
   
2. **Comprehensive Admin Panel**: A dedicated admin panel for the company to manage and monitor bookings, services, customer interactions, and more. This panel is designed to give complete control to the business for managing operations.

The platform provides an easy-to-use **booking system** for pest control services offered by **Super Star Pest Control Services Pvt. Ltd**.


## üéØ Purpose

The primary goal of the **Super Star Pest Control Services** project is to provide an easy and efficient way for customers to book pest control services online. This platform enables seamless interaction between the customers and the company, **Super Star Pest Control Services Pvt. Ltd.**

### Key Objectives:
- **User Convenience**: Allow customers to book pest control services from anywhere, anytime, using an intuitive web interface.
- **Efficient Management**: Provide an **Admin Panel** for the company to manage customer requests, service bookings, and track job progress.
- **Service Transparency**: Ensure customers receive clear and detailed information about the available services, making it easy to choose the best solution for their needs.


## üìä Project Overview

**Super Star Pest Control Services** is a comprehensive platform that enables users to book pest control services conveniently through a website, while also providing an efficient admin panel for company management.

### **Website Features (User Side)**:
1. **Service Catalog**: The website showcases all the pest control services provided by **Super Star Pest Control Services Pvt. Ltd**. Each service comes with a detailed description, including its importance, frequency of service (e.g., after how many days the service should be repeated), and more.
   
2. **Slot Booking System**: Users can select a convenient time slot for their pest control service booking. The system ensures that the user gets the right time and date based on their preferences.
   
3. **Payment Integration**: After booking a slot, users can pay the required amount for the service using an integrated payment system, which ensures a seamless payment experience.

4. **Ongoing and Future Offers**: Users can view any ongoing offers and upcoming discounts directly on the website. This feature helps users take advantage of promotional deals.

### **Admin Panel Features (Company Side)**:
1. **Employee Assignment**: After a booking is made, the company manager or admin can assign an employee to the job for inspection and work completion. This ensures that every job is assigned to the right employee in a timely manner.

2. **Customer SMS Notifications**: Once a booking is made, the system automatically sends the customer details (name, phone, address, and service information) via SMS. This helps the assigned employee easily find the client's location and provide the service without delay.

3. **Service Management**: The admin panel allows the company to manage all aspects of the service, including customer interactions, job scheduling, and employee coordination.

### **How It Works**:
- **User Side**: Users can browse services, choose the service they need, select a time slot, and pay for the service online.
- **Admin Side**: After a booking, the admin assigns employees, tracks the progress of the job, and ensures smooth communication with the customer.

This system provides a seamless experience for both users and company managers, making pest control services more accessible and manageable.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

The **Super Star Pest Control Services** project utilizes a variety of modern technologies for both the website and the admin panel. Below is the breakdown of the tech stack used:

### **Backend**:
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for backend development.

- **Bootstrap**: A popular open-source CSS framework for responsive, mobile-first web development.

### **Frontend (Admin Panel)**:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for creating a dynamic and responsive admin panel.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used in the admin panel for rapid UI development and consistent styling.

### **Database**:
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and manage all application data, including user information, bookings, and service details.

### **APIs & External Tools**:
- **SMTP**: For sending email notifications and alerts to users and admin.
- **Twilio**: For sending SMS notifications to users and employees about booking details and updates.
