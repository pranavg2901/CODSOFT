# üñ•Ô∏è Backend Documentation

The backend of the **Develop Guard India Pvt. Ltd. Website** is built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. This section explains the backend structure, configuration, and API endpoints.


## **1. Frameworks and Libraries**

The backend uses the following libraries and frameworks:

- **Flask**: Main web framework for handling routes and APIs.
- **Flask-Mail**: Used for sending email notifications.
- **python-dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
- **python-decouple**: To securely manage application settings.
- **Jinja2**: Template engine for rendering HTML pages.
- **Werkzeug**: Provides utilities for WSGI applications.
- **DateTime & pytz**: For date and time management.

All required dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## **2. Environment Configuration**

The backend uses environment variables for secure configuration. Below is the structure of the `.env` file:

### **Environment Variables**
```plaintext
# Secret Key 
SECRET_KEY=                # Flask secret key for session management
FLASK_PORT=                # Port number for running the Flask server
FLASK_DEBUG=               # Debug mode (True/False)
FLASK_ENV=                 # Flask environment (e.g., development/production)

# SMTP Configuration (Gmail)
MAIL_SERVER=               # SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)
MAIL_PORT=                 # SMTP port (587 for TLS, 465 for SSL)
MAIL_USE_TLS=              # Use TLS (True/False)
MAIL_USE_SSL=              # Use SSL (True/False)
MAIL_USERNAME=             # Email address used for sending emails
MAIL_PASSWORD=             # Password for the email address
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=        # Default "From" email address
ADMIN_EMAIL=               # Email address of the admin/owner
```

Ensure that the `.env` file is placed in the root directory of the project. The application reads these variables using **python-decouple**.



## **3. Application Structure**

### **Entry Point**
The `main.py` file is the entry point of the application. It performs the following tasks:
1. Loads the `.env` file for configuration.
2. Creates the Flask app using `create_app()`.
3. Runs the application on the configured port and debug mode.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port, debug=debug)
```



## **4. URLs (Frontend Routes)**

The backend serves the following frontend pages:

| **Route**      | **Description**               | **Template Rendered**  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `/`            | Home Page                     | `index.html`           |
| `/about`       | About Us Page                 | `about.html`           |

| `/privacy`     | Privacy Policy Page           | `privacy.html`         |

Each route renders an HTML template using the Jinja2 template engine.

Example:
```python
@main.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')
```



## **5. APIs (Form Submission)**

The application exposes the following APIs for form submission and email notifications:

  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
      "status": "success",
      "message": "Your inquiry has been submitted successfully."
  }
  ```

### **2. Career Form API**

  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
      "status": "success",
      "message": "Your job application has been submitted successfully."
  }
  ```



## **6. Email Configuration**

The application uses **Flask-Mail** for sending emails. The SMTP configuration is managed through environment variables in the `.env` file.

### **Email Example**:
1. **Contact Form Submission**:
   - Sends an email to the admin with the user's inquiry details.
   - Subject: `New Inquiry Received`
   - Body: Includes the user's name, email, and message.

2. **Job Application Submission**:

    DocumentRoot /var/www/BSS03

    WSGIDaemonProcess bss03_nonssl python-home=/var/www/BSS03/venv python-path=/var/www/BSS03
    WSGIProcessGroup bss03_nonssl
    WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/BSS03/wsgi.py

    <Directory /var/www/BSS03>
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    # Optional: redirect HTTP to HTTPS
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [END,NE,R=permanent]

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/bss03_error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/bss03_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

#### **HTTPS Configuration (Port 443)**
- Configured for secure communication using SSL.
- Example configuration:
```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName developguardindia.com
    ServerAlias www.developguardindia.com
    ServerAdmin support@beginningsolutions.in
    DocumentRoot /var/www/BSS03

    WSGIDaemonProcess bss03_ssl python-home=/var/www/BSS03/venv python-path=/var/www/BSS03
    WSGIProcessGroup bss03_ssl
    WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/BSS03/wsgi.py

    <Directory /var/www/BSS03>
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    SSLEngine on

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/bss03_ssl_error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/bss03_ssl_access.log combined
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/developguardindia.com/fullchain.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/developguardindia.com/privkey.pem
    Include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf
</VirtualHost>
```


## **4. Logs**

### **Log Files**

- **Access Logs**: `/var/log/apache2/access.log`

### **Accessing Logs**
To view the logs, use the following commands:
```bash
# View Apache error log
sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log

# View Apache access log
sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
```


## **5. Deployment Process**

### **Steps to Update and Deploy Code**
1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/BSS03
   ```

2. **Reset and Pull the Latest Code**:
   ```bash
   sudo git reset --hard
   sudo git pull
   ```
   - Enter the GitHub username and password when prompted.

3. **Activate Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Run the Project**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   - Verify that the changes are working by testing the application locally on the server.

5. **Stop the Application**:
   - Use `Ctrl+C` to stop the running application.
   - Deactivate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     deactivate
     ```

6. **Restart Apache Server**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```


## **6. Debugging Deployment Issues**

### **Common Errors**
- **500 Internal Server Error**:
  - Check the Apache error log:
    ```bash
    sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log
    ```

- **Application Not Running**:
  - Verify the virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed.

- **SSL Certificate Issues**:
  - Ensure Certbot is properly configured and certificates are valid:
    ```bash
    sudo certbot renew
    ```


## **7. SSL Configuration**

### **SSL Certificate**
- The SSL certificate is managed using **Certbot**.
- Certificate files:
  - `/etc/letsencrypt/live/developguardindia.com/fullchain.pem`
  - `/etc/letsencrypt/live/developguardindia.com/privkey.pem`

### **Renewing SSL Certificate**
To renew the SSL certificate:
```bash
sudo certbot renew
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

This deployment documentation ensures a smooth process for deploying updates, debugging issues, and maintaining the application on the VPS server.
